Hello,

MySociety (http://www.mysociety.org) has referred us to you.

We are a Civic Hacking group of ~20 members in the process of registering as an NGO. We are creating websites for the people in Bulgaria. Think of us as "Code For Bulgaria". We have 3 ongoing projects:

1) Integration of Alaveteli http://www.alaveteli.org - online platform for sumbitting FOI requests
2) RE:CYCLE - website that extensively uses GoogleMaps to illustrate recycle drop off points near you.  
3) OpenParliament - a website that will collect and show MPs info like what businesses they own and what goverment funded projects their businesses are executing. Great tool for transparency.

We are doing all this with 0 funding.
We know Google Grants is not open for Bulgaria but perhaps you like some of our current projects? 
We'll be honoured to have an opportunity to discuss this further, out of the 1000 char limit.
